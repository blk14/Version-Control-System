# Version-Control-System
  This is the implementation of a Version Control System simulation  which has the role to do a minimum set of unix instructions such as: create, change or delete files. Also, the application can do vcs instructions (such as: status, branch, commit, checkout, log or rollback) and is able to save the current state of the file system. The purpose of this application is to be able to come back to prevoius states of the file system.
  In this application you can create files, write something in, etc. And all of this changes will be memorised in staging. Eventually if we give a commit command the staging area will be empty and the changes will be saved as a commit in a special array of commits (each branch has this type of array). Also, we can create braches. This is a project in java and I used vistor pattern where every type of command extends a class which "accept" a vistor class, from "accept" method si called the "visit" method from visitor, then from visitor is called "execute" method for that specific command.
